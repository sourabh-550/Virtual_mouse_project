'''
#np.abs(...):

Takes the absolute value of the resulting degree measure.
This ensures the angle is non-negative, as angles can be negative depending on the direction of the vectors.


#np.degrees(radians):

Converts the angle from radians to degrees.
Since angles in trigonometric functions like arctan2 are calculated in radians by default, 
this step converts it into a more human-readable format.
